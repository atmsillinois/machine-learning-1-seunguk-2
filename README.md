Module 5 Homework - SeungUk Kim

## Overview
This is a description about the jupyter notebook for Fall 2022 - ATMS 523 Homework5. `Module5.ipynb` shows the performance of statistical models to estimate rain rate with radar measurement variables. Baseline prediction (Part 1; empirical model), linear regression (Part 1), polynomial model (with grid search; Part 2), and random forest regression (with grid search; Part 3) are applied.
