    "Roughly, it takes about 2-3 time more time by adding an order. If we are going to fit model for 0-21 order polynomial models, it will result in 440*(2^12) ~ 500hr from my own machine. I'm not sure about the order of calculation, but I assumed **O(n*log(n))** to fit the n-th order polynomial to put it simple. If it was true, it should take less than 30 min to fit up to 21th order polynomial model. However, it seems consuming more time. \n"
